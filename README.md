Credit Card Fraud Detection. Working on a Kaggle Dataset

Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

Similar to the Movie-Genre-Prediction dataset, this dataset also contains a whole lot of imbalance between the fraudulent cases (~2% of the dataset) and the non-fraudulent cases (~98% of the dataset). Due to this, the accuracy is quite high but it also has the same problem of low precision, recall and f1 scores.
